h2. What are Permissions ?

permission is a boolean expression (TRUE/FALSE) that determine who/when could view/edit/update...etc a piece of content or a section.

h2.What are the permissions tokens ?

you can use 2 types of tokens :
# *Connector* : and, or, not
# *Operator* : =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, !
# *Boolean variables* : (True/false) variable like ,admin, logged, guest, view, edit
# *Numeric variables* : group, user, section, day, month, year
the permission syntax is :

```text
expression Connector expression
expression = expression Connector expression 
expression = {BooleanVariable} or {NumericVar Oper Number}
```

example :

```text
guest or user=4 and day=13
```

that will be true if the user guest in or user ID equal to 4 and the current day is 13,
if you want to exclude user 14 from the permission.

```text
guest or !user=4 and day=13
```
that will show for guest user or not the user 4 and day is 13

some other examples :
```text
logged
```
```text
admin or group=5
```
```text
!group=6 and user=5 and user=7
```
```text
group=3 and day>1 and day<10 and year>=2011
```
